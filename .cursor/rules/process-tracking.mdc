 # Background Process Command Rule

As a Cursor assistant, I must:

- ALWAYS think first whether the command I am about to execute is a long-running process or not (examples are server processes, log tailing etc.)
- If the command is a long-running process
   - ALWAYS check first if the process is already running, and if it is, do not start it again
   - ALWAYS pop-out the terminal when starting a long-running process
