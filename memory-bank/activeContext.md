# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is in the initial development phase with a focus on implementing the core ranking functionality. We're building the foundational Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend with Airtable integration.

## Recent Changes
- Set up the Next.js project structure with TypeScript
- Created the FastAPI backend with Airtable integration
- Implemented the interactive merge sort algorithm
- Designed the UI components for item comparison
- Added functionality to create and delete items
- Implemented the sorting session management
- Added environment variable configuration

## Next Steps
1. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Add comprehensive error handling in the API
   - Implement user-friendly error messages in the UI
   
2. **Enhance UI/UX**:
   - Refine the comparison UI for better visual clarity
   - Add animations for transitions between comparisons
   - Improve keyboard navigation experience
   
3. **Add Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for the sorting algorithm
   - Add integration tests for the API endpoints
   - Create E2E tests for the user flows

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize the sorting algorithm for larger datasets
   - Improve loading states and perceived performance
   - Add caching where appropriate

5. **Documentation**:
   - Complete API documentation
   - Add comprehensive setup instructions
   - Create user guide for the application

## Active Decisions
- **State Management**: Using React's useState hooks for frontend state management instead of more complex state management libraries to keep the application simple initially.
  
- **Deployment Strategy**: Planning to deploy both frontend and backend to Vercel for simplicity and integration.
  
- **Styling Approach**: Using Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling to enable rapid UI development.
  
- **API Structure**: Designing a RESTful API with clear resource-based endpoints for maintainability and scalability.

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring smooth state transitions during the sorting process
- Managing the UI state for loading and error conditions
- Optimizing the number of comparisons needed for ranking
- Managing environment variables across development and production
- Designing an intuitive UI for the comparison process
