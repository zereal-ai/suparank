# Progress

## Current Status
The project is in active development with core functionality implemented. The basic application flow works, but several enhancements and refinements are still needed.

## What Works
1. ✅ **Next.js Frontend Base Setup**
   - Project structure established
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Tailwind CSS integration

2. ✅ **FastAPI Backend**
   - API endpoints for items and sorting
   - Airtable integration
   - CORS configuration

3. ✅ **Core Functionality**
   - Adding items with title and description
   - Deleting items
   - Starting sorting sessions
   - Presenting items for comparison
   - Processing user choices
   - Displaying final rankings

4. ✅ **UI Components**
   - Main page layout
   - Item entry form
   - Comparison interface
   - Ranking list display
   - Loading states

5. ✅ **Deployment Setup**
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Vercel configuration file

## What's In Progress
1. 🟡 **Error Handling**
   - Basic error handling implemented
   - Need more comprehensive error states and recovery

2. 🟡 **Responsive Design**
   - Basic responsiveness implemented
   - Need refinement for various screen sizes

3. 🟡 **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Basic keyboard navigation
   - Need improvements for accessibility and usability

## What's Left to Build
1. 🔲 **Testing Suite**
   - Unit tests for core functions
   - Integration tests for API
   - End-to-end tests for user flows

2. 🔲 **Advanced Features**
   - User accounts and authentication
   - Saving multiple ranking sessions
   - Exporting ranked lists
   - Sharing functionality

3. 🔲 **Performance Optimizations**
   - Caching strategies
   - Optimized sorting for larger datasets
   - Lazy loading for improved performance

4. 🔲 **Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - User guide
   - Developer documentation

## Known Issues
1. 🐞 **Environment Handling**
   - Development/production environment detection needs improvement
   - API URL configuration can be inconsistent

2. 🐞 **Edge Cases in Sorting Algorithm**
   - Handling very large datasets may cause performance issues
   - Error recovery during sorting needs improvement

3. 🐞 **UI/UX Refinements Needed**
   - Loading states could be more informative
   - Error messages need to be more user-friendly
   - Mobile experience needs optimization

## Next Release Goals
For the next milestone release (v0.2.0), we aim to:
1. Complete error handling improvements
2. Add unit tests for core functionality
3. Enhance the responsive design
4. Refine the comparison UI for better usability
5. Add keyboard shortcuts documentation
